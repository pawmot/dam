# Digital Asset Managment

A simple project that I use for getting used to a couple of technologies, e.g.:
* Apache Camel
* ActiveMQ
* Spring Boot
* Docker
* Hibernate

## Starting
Get into the root directory of the project and execute:
_./gradlew dockerize_

After about 30s (YMMV) the app will respond at **localhost:8080**
